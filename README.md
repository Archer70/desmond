# Desmond
*Put some LISP in your PHP.*

## Goals
The basic idea here is to create small and fast LISP interpreter for PHP that focuses on functional programming, while also allowing interoperation with PHP itself. Theoretically, you could add Desmond on top of an existing PHP code base, allowing lispy goodness that has access to the application it sits on.
